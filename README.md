🦷 Crown Dental Clinic Database System
📌 Introduction
The Crown Dental Clinic Database System is a SQL-based database project created to replace the clinic’s paper-based record system.
Previously, the clinic stored patient information manually on paper. This caused problems such as:

-Missing or lost documents
-Slow information searching
-Appointment conflicts
-Billing mistakes

To solve these issues, this project develops a relational database system using SQL to manage clinic data more efficiently and accurately.
