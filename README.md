🦷 Crown Dental Clinic Database System
📌 Introduction
The Crown Dental Clinic Database System is a SQL-based database project created to replace the clinic’s paper-based record system.
Previously, the clinic stored patient information manually on paper. This caused problems such as:

-Missing or lost documents
-Slow information searching
-Appointment conflicts
-Billing mistakes

To solve these issues, this project develops a relational database system using SQL to manage clinic data more efficiently and accurately.

🎯 Project Objectives
-Store patient information digitally
-Manage appointments without conflicts
-Record treatments properly
-Track billing and payments
-Reduce human errors
-Improve overall clinic efficiency

🛠 Tools & Technology
-SQL (Structured Query Language)
-Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
-ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
-Database Normalization (up to 3NF)
